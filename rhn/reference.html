    <h4>In the course of building this site, I made reference to the following materials:</h4>
    <p>- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints website where I obtained the various images of temples I heavily made use of.</p>
    <p>- I search w3schools for clarification on some array methods</p>
    <p>- I also made use of the Nigeria Property Centre website to gain some insight and inspiration</p>
